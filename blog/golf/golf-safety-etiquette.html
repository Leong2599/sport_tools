            <p>Golf's unique combination of physical skill, mental strategy, and traditional values creates a sport where safety and etiquette are as important as technical ability.

This self-governing nature makes understanding and practicing proper safety protocols and etiquette essential for every golfer, from beginners to experienced players. Mastering these guidelines not only prevents accidents and conflicts but also preserves the game's traditions, enhances enjoyment for all players, and demonstrates respect for the sport, fellow players, and the course itself.</p>
