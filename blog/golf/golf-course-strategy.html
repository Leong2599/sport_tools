            <p>Golf is as much a mental chess match as it is a physical game. While proper swing mechanics are essential, strategic course management often separates good players from great ones. The ability to think your way around the course, make smart decisions, and play to your strengths can save 5-10 strokes per round regardless of your swing quality. Understanding course strategy transforms golf from a game of hit-and-hope to a calculated exercise in risk management and optimal shot selection.</p>

            <h2>The Foundation of Course Strategy</h2>
            <p>Effective course strategy begins long before you step onto the first tee. It requires understanding your capabilities, assessing the challenges ahead, and developing a systematic approach to decision-making. Strategic golfers play the percentages, minimize mistakes, and capitalize on opportunities while avoiding unnecessary risks.</p>
            
            <h3>Knowing Your Game</h3>
            <p>The first rule of course strategy is honest self-assessment. You must understand your strengths, weaknesses, tendencies, and current skill level to make optimal decisions on the course.</p>
