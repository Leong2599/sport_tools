        <article class="blog-content">
            <p>Why do Americans call the beautiful game "soccer" while most of the world calls it "football"? The answer reveals a fascinating history of how the sport evolved and spread across different cultures. This linguistic journey through time explains the origins of both terms and how they came to represent the same beloved sport.</p>

            <h2>The Origins: A Brief History of the Game</h2>

            <h3>Ancient Roots</h3>
            <p>Games involving kicking a ball date back thousands of years:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ancient China (2500 BCE):</strong> Cuju, a game involving kicking a leather ball through a cloth</li>
                <li><strong>Ancient Greece:</strong> Episkyros, a team game with a ball</li>
                <li><strong>Roman Empire:</strong> Harpastum, adapted from Greek games</li>
                <li><strong>Medieval Europe:</strong> Various folk football games, often violent and unstructured</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The British Influence</h3>
            <p>Modern football as we know it emerged in 19th century England:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1848:</strong> Cambridge Rules formalized the game</li>
                <li><strong>1863:</strong> Football Association (FA) founded in London</li>
                <li><strong>1871:</strong> FA Cup established, first major competition</li>
                <li><strong>1888:</strong> Football League created, first professional league</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Birth of "Soccer"</h2>

            <h3>Oxford Slang Origins</h3>
            <p>Surprisingly, "soccer" originated as British slang in the 1880s:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Oxford University students loved to abbreviate and add "-er" suffixes</li>
                <li>"Association Football" became "assoccer"</li>
                <li>This was later shortened to "soccer"</li>
                <li>Other examples: "rugger" for rugby, "brekker" for breakfast</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Distinguishing from Rugby</h3>
            <p>The term emerged to differentiate between two codes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Association Football:</strong> Played primarily with feet</li>
                <li><strong>Rugby Football:</strong> Allowed carrying the ball</li>
                <li>"Soccer" identified association football specifically</li>
                <li>"Rugger" became rugby football's nickname</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Spread to America</h2>

            <h3>Early American Football History</h3>
            <p>When the sport arrived in America, another sport was already claiming the "football" name:</p>

                <li>Developed from rugby but with unique American innovations</li>
                <li>Walter Camp established modern American football rules in 1880s</li>
                <li>By early 1900s, "football" in America meant the American version</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Soccer in the United States</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Immigration brought association football to America</li>
                <li>Used "soccer" to avoid confusion with American football</li>
                <li>Early soccer leagues formed in industrial cities</li>
                <li>Term "soccer" became standard in American English</li>
            </ul>
