            <p>Proper nutrition is the foundation of peak soccer performance. What you eat before, during, and after games can significantly impact your energy levels, endurance, and recovery. This comprehensive guide will help you optimize your diet for maximum performance on the soccer field.</p>

            <h2>The Importance of Carbohydrates</h2>
            <p>Soccer is an intense sport that requires both endurance and explosive energy. Carbohydrates are your body's primary fuel source during matches. Aim for 5-7 grams of carbohydrates per kilogram of body weight daily during training periods.</p>

            <p><strong>Best carbohydrate sources for soccer players:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Whole grain pasta and rice</li>
                <li>Sweet potatoes and regular potatoes</li>
                <li>Oatmeal and whole grain bread</li>
                <li>Fruits like bananas, berries, and oranges</li>
                <li>Legumes and quinoa</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Protein for Recovery and Muscle Maintenance</h2>
            <p>Protein is essential for muscle repair and recovery. Soccer players should consume 1.4-1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily.</p>

            <p><strong>Excellent protein sources include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lean meats (chicken, turkey, lean beef)</li>
                <li>Fish (salmon, tuna, mackerel)</li>
                <li>Eggs and dairy products</li>
                <li>Plant-based options (tofu, beans, lentils)</li>
                <li>Protein supplements for post-workout recovery</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Pre-Game Nutrition Strategy</h2>
            <p>What you eat before a game can make or break your performance. Follow these timing guidelines:</p>

            <h3>3-4 Hours Before Game</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Balanced meal with complex carbs and lean protein</li>
                <li>Example: Grilled chicken with pasta and vegetables</li>
                <li>Avoid high-fat and high-fiber foods</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1-2 Hours Before Game</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Light carbohydrate-rich snack</li>
                <li>Example: Banana with peanut butter or sports drink</li>
                <li>Keep portions small to avoid digestive issues</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>30 Minutes Before Game</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple carbohydrates for quick energy</li>
                <li>Example: Energy gel or sports drink</li>
                <li>Avoid anything new or unfamiliar</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Hydration: The Performance Enhancer</h2>
            <p>Proper hydration is crucial for soccer performance. Even mild dehydration can significantly impact your speed, endurance, and decision-making abilities.</p>

            <h3>Hydration Guidelines:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Drink 500ml (17 oz) of water 2 hours before the game</li>
                <li>Consume 250ml (8 oz) 30 minutes before kickoff</li>
                <li>Drink 150-200ml every 15-20 minutes during the game</li>
                <li>Replace fluids lost during play (weigh yourself before and after)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Post-Game Recovery Nutrition</h2>
            <p>Recovery begins immediately after the final whistle. The 30-minute window after exercise is crucial for optimal recovery.</p>

            <h3>Immediate Recovery (Within 30 minutes)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Carbohydrate-to-protein ratio of 3:1 or 4:1</li>
                <li>Examples: Chocolate milk, fruit smoothie with protein powder</li>
                <li>Continue hydrating with water or electrolyte drinks</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Full Recovery Meal (Within 2 hours)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Balanced meal with lean protein and complex carbs</li>
                <li>Include vegetables for vitamins and minerals</li>
                <li>Example: Salmon with sweet potato and steamed broccoli</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Supplements for Soccer Players</h2>
            <p>While a balanced diet should be your primary focus, certain supplements can support performance:</p>

            <h3>Consider These Supplements:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Omega-3 fatty acids:</strong> Reduce inflammation and support brain health</li>
                <li><strong>Vitamin D:</strong> Essential for bone health and immune function</li>
                <li><strong>Iron:</strong> Crucial for oxygen transport (especially for female athletes)</li>
                <li><strong>Creatine:</strong> May help with repeated sprint performance</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Foods to Limit or Avoid</h2>
            <p>Certain foods can negatively impact your performance and should be limited:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Highly processed foods and sugary snacks</li>
                <li>Fried foods and excessive saturated fats</li>
                <li>Alcohol (dehydrates and impairs recovery)</li>
                <li>Excessive caffeine (can affect sleep quality)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Sample Daily Meal Plan</h2>
            <h3>Breakfast (7:00 AM)</h3>
            <p>Oatmeal with berries, nuts, and a scoop of protein powder. Whole grain toast with avocado.</p>

            <h3>Mid-Morning Snack (10:00 AM)</h3>
