            <p>Basketball formations and tactical systems are the blueprint for team success. Whether you're a coach designing game plans or a player trying to understand team strategy, knowing different formations and their applications is essential. This comprehensive guide covers everything from basic defensive formations to complex offensive sets that will help you understand and execute basketball tactics at any level.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Basketball Formations</h2>
            <p>Basketball formations are organized arrangements of players on the court designed to maximize team strengths and exploit opponent weaknesses. They provide structure for both offensive and defensive play.</p>

            <h3>Key Principles of Formations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Proper court spacing creates scoring opportunities</li>
                <li><strong>Balance:</strong> Maintain defensive and offensive balance</li>
                <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Players must understand and communicate their roles</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Formations should adapt to different situations</li>
                <li><strong>Execution:</strong> Proper execution is more important than complexity</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Defensive Formations</h2>
            <p>Defensive formations are designed to prevent scoring, create turnovers, and control the tempo of the game.</p>

            <h3>Man-to-Man Defense</h3>
            <p>The most fundamental defensive formation where each player guards a specific opponent.</p>

            <h4>Basic Man-to-Man Principles</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Each defender responsible for one offensive player</li>
                <li>Maintain proper defensive positioning and stance</li>
                <li>Communicate screens and help situations</li>
                <li>Box out and secure rebounds</li>
                <li>Force opponents to weak areas of the court</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Advantages of Man-to-Man</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Clear defensive responsibilities</li>
                <li>Effective against poor shooting teams</li>
                <li>Creates pressure on ball handlers</li>
                <li>Good for teams with athletic defenders</li>
                <li>Limits opponent's offensive flow</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Disadvantages of Man-to-Man</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Vulnerable to mismatches</li>
                <li>Can be exposed by screens and picks</li>
                <li>Requires high individual defensive skill</li>
                <li>Can lead to foul trouble</li>
                <li>Poor help defense if not executed properly</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Zone Defense Formations</h3>
            <p>Zone defenses assign players to specific areas rather than specific opponents.</p>

            <h4>2-3 Zone Defense</h4>
            <p>The most common zone formation with two guards at the top and three players across the baseline.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Setup:</strong> Two guards at free throw line extended, three players across baseline</li>
                <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Protects the paint, good against driving teams</li>
                <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Vulnerable to outside shooting, high post</li>
                <li><strong>Best Against:</strong> Teams that drive to the basket, poor outside shooters</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3-2 Zone Defense</h4>
            <p>Three players across the top, two players across the baseline.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Setup:</strong> Three guards at perimeter, two players near basket</li>
                <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Good against outside shooting, pressure on perimeter</li>

                <li><strong>Best Against:</strong> Teams with good outside shooters</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>1-3-1 Zone Defense</h4>
            <p>One player at the top, three across the middle, one at the baseline.</p>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Confuses offenses, good against motion offenses</li>
                <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Vulnerable to corner shooting, high post</li>
                <li><strong>Best Against:</strong> Teams with complex offensive sets</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>1-2-2 Zone Defense</h4>
            <p>One player at the top, two across the free throw line, two across the baseline.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Setup:</strong> One guard at top, two at free throw line, two at baseline</li>
                <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Good balance between perimeter and paint protection</li>
                <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Can be stretched by good outside shooting</li>
                <li><strong>Best Against:</strong> Balanced offensive teams</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Hybrid and Combination Defenses</h3>
