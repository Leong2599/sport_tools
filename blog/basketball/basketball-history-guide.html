            <p>From a simple game invented to keep athletes in shape during winter to a global cultural phenomenon, basketball's journey is one of innovation, adaptation, and incredible growth. This comprehensive guide explores the fascinating history of basketball, from its humble beginnings to its current status as one of the world's most popular sports.</p>

            <h2>The Birth of Basketball (1891)</h2>
            <p>Basketball was invented by Dr. James Naismith in December 1891 at the International YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts. Tasked with creating an indoor game to keep athletes in shape during harsh New England winters, Naismith drew inspiration from various sports and childhood games.</p>

            <h3>Original Basketball Rules</h3>
            <p>Naismith created 13 original rules that formed the foundation of basketball:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The ball could be thrown in any direction with one or both hands</li>
                <li>The ball could be batted in any direction with one or both hands</li>
                <li>A player couldn't run with the ball (had to throw from where caught)</li>
                <li>The ball had to be held in or between the hands (not arms or body)</li>
                <li>No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping, or striking was allowed</li>
                <li>A foul was striking the ball with the fist</li>
                <li>Two fouls resulted in disqualification until the next goal</li>
                <li>A goal was made when the ball stayed in the basket</li>
                <li>If the ball went out of bounds, it was thrown back in</li>
                <li>The umpire would judge play and call fouls</li>
                <li>The referee would judge when the ball was in play</li>
                <li>The game consisted of two 15-minute halves</li>
                <li>The team scoring the most goals won</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>First Game</h3>
            <p>The first basketball game was played on December 21, 1891, with 18 students divided into two teams of nine. The final score was 1-0, with the only basket scored from 25 feet away. The game used peach baskets as hoops and a soccer ball as the basketball.</p>
