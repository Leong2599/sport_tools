        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>From wooden walking machines with no pedals to carbon fiber racing machines weighing less than 15 pounds, the bicycle has undergone one of the most remarkable evolutions in transportation history. This comprehensive guide traces the fascinating journey of cycling from its humble beginnings to its current status as a global sport, transportation solution, and cultural phenomenon.</p>

            <h2>The Early Beginnings (1817-1860s)</h2>
            <p>The story of cycling begins not with a bicycle, but with a walking machine that required riders to push themselves forward with their feet.</p>

            <h3>The Draisine (1817)</h3>
            <p>German Baron Karl von Drais invented the first two-wheeled vehicle, known as the "Draisine" or "Laufmaschine" (running machine). This wooden vehicle had no pedals, no chains, and no brakes - riders simply sat on it and pushed with their feet to move forward.</p>

            <h3>Key Features of the Draisine</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Wooden frame with two iron-rimmed wheels</li>
                <li>Steerable front wheel</li>
                <li>No pedals or propulsion system</li>
                <li>Could reach speeds of up to 10 mph on downhill sections</li>
                <li>Became popular among wealthy Europeans as a novelty</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Velocipede Era (1860s)</h3>
            <p>French blacksmith Pierre Michaux and his son Ernest added cranks and pedals to the front wheel in the 1860s, creating the first true bicycle - the velocipede. These were often called "boneshakers" due to their rough ride quality.</p>

            <h3>Velocipede Innovations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1861:</strong> First pedals attached to front wheel</li>
                <li><strong>1863:</strong> Iron frame replaced wood for durability</li>
                <li><strong>1868:</strong> First documented bicycle race in Paris</li>
                <li><strong>1869:</strong> First long-distance ride (Paris to Rouen)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Penny Farthing Era (1870s-1880s)</h2>
            <p>The high-wheel bicycle, commonly known as the penny farthing, represented the first major design shift in bicycle engineering.</p>

            <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
            <p>The penny farthing's design was based on a simple principle: the larger the front wheel, the greater the distance traveled with each pedal rotation. This led to the iconic design with a huge front wheel and small rear wheel.</p>

            <h3>Technical Characteristics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Front wheel diameter up to 60 inches</li>
                <li>Direct drive - pedals attached directly to front wheel</li>
                <li>Solid rubber tires</li>
                <li>No brakes - riders had to slow down by backpedaling</li>
                <li>High center of gravity - frequent falls were common</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Safety Bicycle Revolution (1885-1890)</h3>
            <p>The invention of the "safety bicycle" marked the most significant breakthrough in cycling history, making cycling accessible to the masses.</p>
